# workshops
A collection of matlab (live)scripts used in andreas' workshops.
These are designed to have minimal labor involved to get running, but some require functions from the libas folder, also located here. 
To use the livescripts, download or clone this folder, put into matlab path or navigate matlab into the downlaoded folder. 
Then open a live script (each ends in .mlx) in the latlab editor and click on the blue bars on the left (requires matlab2021 or highr)
For people who do not do matlab, most of these scripts exist as a python library by Dr. Ryan Mears, on this same github page in the m2py repository
The goal of these scripts is to illustrate selected principles of signal processing.
