# workshops
A collection of matlab (live)scripts used in andreas' workshops.
These are designed to have minimal labor involved when running
To use, download folder, put into matlab path or navigate matlab into the downlaoded folder. 
Then open a live script (each ends in .mlx) and click on blue bars on the left (requires matlab 2021 or highr)
Most of these scripts exist as a pythin library by Dr. Ryan Mears, on this same github page in the m2py repository
The goal of these scripts is to illustrate selected principles of signal processing.
